1)  Done.
2)  Done.
3)  The new command "timedate" was implemented to print on the screen the RTC time/date.
    For this was used the BIOS service 1A/02 for RTC time and 1A/04 for RTC date. 
    These services return:
        BIOS service 1A/04:
            CL = year in BCD
            DH = month in BCD
            DL = day in BCD

        BIOS service 1A/02:
            CH = hours in BCD
            CL = minutes in BCD
            DH = seconds in BCD
    
    So, for each return was needed to convert BCD to ASCII and print on the screen.

    One interesting point was during the implementation I had problems with the space to write my program.
    So the code was optimized to use less memory and the command help was removed.
